fixmszip is a program to fix large (>4GB) zip files created on Microsoft
Windows so that Mac/Unix zip tools work with them.

If a Windows user right clicks a large file or folder and selects
"Send to compressed (zipped) folder", if the resulting file is >4GB it
is not usable by unzip/zipinfo on unix and linux platforms or the Mac
archive utility. Analysis of problematic zip files reveals that this is
because Windows does not set the "Total Number of Disks" field in theZip64
"End of Central Directory Locator" (EOCDL).

This utility:
    * Checks that a file appears to be a valid zip file
    * Checks that it is large enough to require a Zip64 EOCDL
    * Checks that the EOCDL looks valid and contins a zero "Total Number
      of Disks" field
    * Sets the "Total Number of Disks" field to 1
